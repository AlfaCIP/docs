While we are developing separate applications for the Fetch.AI Ledger, Python API, and Open Economic Framework, make sure all the versions match up.

For example:

``` c++
fetchai/ledger release/v0.5.x
fetchai/ledger-api-py release/v0.5.x
fetchai/oef-search-pluto master
```

Against these, documentation should be in line with the same versions.

The documentation you are reading now is from version:

``` c++
	fetchai/docs release/v0.5.x
```
