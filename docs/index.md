    <h1>What is Fetch.ai</h1>
    <p> There are billions of devices, processes and pipelines around the world that are desperate for automation and communication. No other blockchain is built to handle all that data, and none offer a real ability to allow learning to be made on this data. This at our core is what Fetch.ai was built to solve, we connect devices, we bring value to data, we are the platform for autonomy to happen. </p>

    <h1>What can you do with Fetch.ai</h1>
    <p> Right now, we offer open source access to all of our repositories. This means you can fork and build whatever you like from the Fetch.ai stack. If you don't want to go that far, take a look at our SDKs (Python ledger API, JS Ledeger API, Agent Framework and Etch) so you can build Smart Contracts, new agents connected to Fetch.ai, or build new ways of interacting with the ledger.</p>

    <h1>Versions, and notes</h1>
      <p>As with all documentation, things do change. We at Fetch.ai try to suppport backwards compatibility as much as possible, but deprecations will, and do occur. Keep a note of our release notes, as this details all major changed and if you want to view older versions of the docs, select them from the drop down at the bottom of the left hand menu.</p>
